## Introduction
[Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org/en/) is a resilient blockchain platform for
contractual money. In addition to [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/)-like
blockchain architecture Ergo provides advanced contractual capabilities, which
are not possible in Bitcoin.

Because of these capabilities numerous decentralized applications become
possible(see [ErgoScript](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/ErgoScript.pdf),
[Advanced ErgoScript
examples](https://ergoplatform.org/docs/AdvancedErgoScriptTutorial.pdf),
[CrowdFunding](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2019_09_06_crowdfund/),
[Auctions On Ergo](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/auctions-on-ergo/122),
[Interest-Free Loan
Contract](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/interest-free-loan-contract/67) etc). Ergo
applications can avoid centralization of trust and instead rely on trust-less
truly decentralized protocols which are implemented using Ergo contracts
deployed on Ergo blockchain.

By its very nature, Ergo applications are both decentralized and cross-platform
ranging from web applications running in browsers, mobile applications running
on Android and iOS, standalone applications executing on Linux, MacOS or Windows
to services deployed in cloud servers.

That said, it is very desirable to provide consistent programming model and APIs
to facilitate all those application scenarios and platforms.

Appkit library is based on [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org) - a novel next
generation approach to implement software which is reusable across several
programming languages and execution environments (see [motivation for using
Graal](#why-graal) below).

Appkit has idiomatic Java API and is written in Java/Scala. It is a thin wrapper
around core components provided by [ErgoScript
interpreter](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter) and
[Ergo protocol](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo) implementations which are
written in Scala.

Using Appkit Ergo applications can be written in one of the languages supported
by GraalVM (i.e. Java, JavaScript, C/C++, Python, Ruby, R) and using this
library applications can communicate with Ergo nodes via unified API and
programming model provided by Appkit. In addition Appkit based Ergo applications
can be compiled into native code using [native-image ahead of time
compiler](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/) and then
executed without Java VM with very fast startup time and lower runtime memory
overhead compared to a Java VM.

Please follow the [setup instructions](#setup) to get started.

## Examples

### Using from Java 

Among other things, Appkit library allows to communicate with Ergo nodes via
REST API. Let's see how we can write a simple Java console application (called
[ErgoTool](examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoToolJava.java))
which uses Appkit library. ErgoTool allows to create and send a new transaction
to an Ergo node which, for example, can be started locally and thus available at
`http://localhost:9052/`. Suppose we [set up a full
node](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Set-up-a-full-node) and started
it using the following command.
```shell
$ java -jar -Xmx4G target/scala-2.12/ergo-3.1.3.jar --testnet -c ergo-testnet.conf
```

We will need some configuration parameters which we can load from
[ergotool.json](ergotool.json) file which looks like this
```json
{
  "node": {
    "nodeApi": {
      "apiUrl": "http://localhost:9051/",
      "apiKey": "82344a18c24adc42b78f52c58facfdf19c8cc38858a5f22e68070959499076e1"
    },
    "wallet": {
      "mnemonic": "slow silly start wash bundle suffer bulb ancient height spin express remind today effort helmet",
      "password": "",
      "mnemonicPassword": ""
    },
    "networkType": "TESTNET"
  }
}
```
Here `apiKey` is the secret key required for API authentication which can be
obtained as described
[here](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Ergo-REST-API#setting-an-api-key).
And mnemonic is the secret phrase obtained during [setup of a new
wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/wiki/Wallet-documentation).

Our example app also reads the amount of NanoErg to put into a new box from command line arguments
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    long amountToPay = Long.parseLong(args[0]);
    ErgoToolConfig conf = ErgoToolConfig.load("ergotool.json");
    int newBoxSpendingDelay = Integer.parseInt(conf.getParameters().get("newBoxSpendingDelay"));
    // the rest of the code shown below 
    ...
}
```

Next we connect to the running testnet node from our Java application by creating
`ErgoClient` instance.
```java
ErgoNodeConfig nodeConf = conf.getNode();
ErgoClient ergoClient = RestApiErgoClient.create(nodeConf);
```

Using `ErgoClient` we can
[execute](lib-api/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/appkit/ErgoClient.java)
any block of code in the current blockchain context.

```java
String txJson = ergoClient.execute((BlockchainContext ctx) -> {
    // here we will use ctx to create and sign a new transaction
    // which then be sent to the node and also serialized into Json
});
```

The lambda passed to `execute` is called when the current blockchain context 
is loaded from the node. This is where we shall put our application logic.
We start with some auxiliary steps.
```java
// access wallet embedded in Ergo node
ErgoWallet wallet = ctx.getWallet();

// calculate total amount of NanoErgs we need to create the new box 
// and pay transaction fees
long totalToSpend = amountToPay + Parameters.MinFee;

// request wallet for unspent boxes that cover required amount of NanoErgs
Optional<List<InputBox>> boxes = wallet.getUnspentBoxes(totalToSpend);
if (!boxes.isPresent())
    throw new ErgoClientException(
        "Not enough coins in the wallet to pay " + totalToSpend, null);
    
// create a so called prover, a special object which will be used for signing the transaction
// the prover should be configured with secrets, which are nessesary to generate signatures (aka proofs)
ErgoProver prover = ctx.newProverBuilder()
    .withMnemonic(
            nodeConf.getWallet().getMnemonic(),
            nodeConf.getWallet().getPassword())
    .build();
```

Now that we have the input boxes to spend in the transaction, we need to create 
an output box with the requested `amountToPay` and the specific contract protecting 
that box.

```java
// the only way to create transaction is using builder obtained from the context
// the builder keeps relationship with the context to access nessary blockchain data.
UnsignedTransactionBuilder txB = ctx.newTxBuilder();

// create new box using new builder obtained from the transaction builder
// in this case we compile new ErgoContract from source ErgoScript code
OutBox newBox = txB.outBoxBuilder()
        .value(amountToPay)
        .contract(ctx.compileContract(
                ConstantsBuilder.create()
                        .item("freezeDeadline", ctx.getHeight() + newBoxDelay)
                        .item("pkOwner", prover.getP2PKAddress().pubkey())
                        .build(),
                "{ sigmaProp(HEIGHT > freezeDeadline) && pkOwner }"))
        .build();
```
Note, in order to compile `ErgoContract` from source code the `compileContract`
method requires to provide values for named constants which are used in the script.
If no such constants are used, then `ConstantsBuilder.empty()` can be passed.

In this specific case we pass public key of the `prover` for `pkOwner` 
placeholder of the script meaning the box can be spend only by the owner of the
Ergo node we are working with. 

Next create an unsigned transaction using all the data collected so far.
```java
// tell transaction builder which boxes we are going to spend, which outputs
// to create, amount of transaction fees and address for change coins.
UnsignedTransaction tx = txB.boxesToSpend(boxes.get())
        .outputs(newBox)
        .fee(Parameters.MinFee)
        .sendChangeTo(prover.getP2PKAddress())
        .build();
```

And finally we use prover to sign the transaction, obtain a new
`SignedTransaction` instance and use context to send it to the Ergo node.
The resulting `txId` can be used to refer to this transaction later and
is not really used here.

```java
SignedTransaction signed = prover.sign(tx);
String txId = ctx.sendTransaction(signed);
return signed.toJson(true);
```
As the last step we serialize signed transaction into Json with turned on pretty
printing. Please see the [full source
code](examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoToolJava.java) of the
example.

### Using from JavaScript

Before running JavaScript example it my be helpful to run Java example
first to make sure everything is set up correctly.

GraalVM can [run JavaScript and
Node.js](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/js/)
applications out of the box and it is compatible with the [ECMAScript 2019
specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html).
Additionally, `js` and `node` launchers accept special `--jvm` and `--polyglot`
command line options which allow JS script to access Java objects and classes.

That said, a JS example of ErgoTool can be executed using Node.js
```shell
$ node --jvm --vm.cp=target/scala-2.12/ergo-appkit-3.1.0.jar \
  examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoTool.js  1000000000
```

Start session for debugging
```shell
$ node --jvm --inspect --vm.cp=target/scala-2.12/ergo-appkit-3.1.0.jar \
  examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoTool.js  1000000000
```

### Using from Python

Before running Python example it my be helpful to run Java example
first to make sure everything is set up correctly.

GraalVM can [run Python
scripts](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/python/), though
the Python implementation is still experimental (see also
[compatibility section](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/python/#python-compatibility)
for details).

[Python example of ErgoTool](examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoTool.py) can be executed using the following command
```shell
$ graalpython --jvm --vm.cp=target/scala-2.12/ergo-appkit-3.1.0.jar \
  --polyglot examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoTool.py 1900000000
```

### Using from Ruby

Before running Ruby example it my be helpful to run Java example
first to make sure everything is set up correctly.

GraalVM can [run Ruby
scripts](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/ruby/), though
the Ruby implementation is still experimental (see also
[compatibility section](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/languages/ruby/#compatibility)
for details).

[Ruby example of ErgoTool](examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoTool.rb) can be executed using the following command
```shell
$ ruby --polyglot --jvm --vm.cp=target/scala-2.12/ergo-appkit-3.1.0.jar 
    examples/src/main/java/org/ergoplatform/example/ErgoTool.rb 1900000000
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Appkit require GraalVM (Community or Enterprise edition) to be
[downloaded](https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/) and installed. Community
edition should be enough for Ergo Appkit library.

#### Install GraalVM Community Edition on MacOS

First you need to download an archive with the [latest
release](https://github.com/oracle/graal/releases) of GraalVM (e.g.
`graalvm-ce-darwin-amd64-19.2.1.tar.gz`) for MacOS and put the programs from it
onto the `$PATH`.

```shell
$ cd <your/directory/with/downloaded/graal>
$ tar -zxf graalvm-ce-darwin-amd64-19.2.1.tar.gz
$ export GRAAL_HOME=<your/directory/with/downloaded/graal>/graalvm-ce-19.2.1/Contents/Home
$ export PATH=$PATH:${GRAAL_HOME}/bin
```

GraalVM comes with a package manager called `gu` that lets you install
additional languages (JavaScript comes with GraalVM). You will also need to
install the `native-image` tool. These all get downloaded from GitHub.
```
$ gu install native-image
$ gu install ruby
$ gu install python
$ gu install R
```
When you run `java` or `js` you'll get the GraalVM versions of those runtimes.
```
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_232"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_232-20191009173705.graal.jdk8u-src-tar-gz-b07)
OpenJDK 64-Bit GraalVM CE 19.2.1 (build 25.232-b07-jvmci-19.2-b03, mixed mode)

$ js --version
GraalVM JavaScript (GraalVM CE Native 19.2.1)
```

### Building the Appkit jar file

At the moment Appkit is not published at public servers, so the whole repository
needs to be clonned and Appkit jar file published locally in the Ivy repository.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:aslesarenko/ergo-appkit.git
$ cd ergo-appkit
$ sbt publishLocal 
```

## Why Polyglot?

After many years of research and development GraalVM project has matured enough end
became [production ready](https://medium.com/graalvm/announcing-graalvm-19-4590cf354df8).

From Ergo perspective GraalVM platform opens many unique opportunities in the
nearest and the distant future. Here is a summary of some GraalVM related facts:

- Ergo node can run on GraalVM without any modifications, in fact GraalVM is
fully compliant with JDK 1.8 (which is minimal requirement for [Ergo Protocol
Client](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo/releases))

- Graal's
[native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image/) tool
can be used to compile JVM applications into native applications which can run
without JVM. It can also produce shared libraries (`*.so` files on Linux and
`*.dylib` files on MacOS) that can be used from C/C++ applications (and also
from JavaScript, Python, etc using FFI).

- All cryptography classes [BouncyCastle Java
library](https://bouncycastle.org/java.html) which are used in Ergo reference
implementation can be compiled to shared library and used from non-JVM
languages.

- All the code from [ErgoScript
interpreter](https://github.com/ScorexFoundation/sigmastate-interpreter/pulls),
[ergo-wallet](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet) and this Appkit is compatible with
`native-image` and can be compiled into either native application or shared library.

- Appkit API interfaces can be used from JavaScript and Python by design. They
can also be used from C/C++ (this is work in progress, and corresponding
examples will be added later).

- Appkit can be pre-compiled to native-image based launchers of both JavaScript
and Python to enjoy fast startup and lower runtime memory
overhead when running scripts (work in progress)

- Appkit native shared library can be used from Python and JavaScript through FFI
(work in progress)
